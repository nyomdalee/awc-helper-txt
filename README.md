# awc-helper-txt

This project aims to help with finding anime for the [Anime Watching Challenge](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=2196122). It provides lists of anime based on criteria that cannot be filtered on MAL itself. It is meant as an alternative/fallback to the 
[awc-helper-client ](https://github.com/Nyomdalee/awc-helper-client).

The lists are sourced from a local MongoDB which is maintained by another project and gets its data from the official MyAnimeList API as well as Jikan.

Lists are up to date to:
